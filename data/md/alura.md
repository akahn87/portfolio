The Alura project is a start to a new project framework. The project is a fork from the [gulp-starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter) by Dan Tello, which is a phenominal starting point for this.

The project will utilize a lot of ES6 syntax. ES6 is the next version of JavaScript. It brings many interesting new features that push JavaScript closer towards being a mature and powerful functional language. Many of its features are available now in the latest versions of Node and io.js. And by using transpilers like Babel.js we can write ES6 syntax in today's browsers.

React has brought about new techniques to JavaScript development like true component-based modularity, unidirectional data flow, immutable data structures and reactive programming. One of these new approaches partly enabled by these trends is universal JavaScript.

Universal JavaScript apps run the same code on the server side and the client to achieve the best of both worlds; fast SEO-friendly server rendered responses, and fast transitions between routes and high interactivity. Getting the benefit of universal JavaScript doesn't mean that you have to write your API in Node. A common pattern is to write a thin Node server for rendering the universal app server-side which then proxies back to an API written in whatever language makes the most business sense.
